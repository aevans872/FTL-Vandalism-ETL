# ETL for Ft. Lauderdale Vandalism Data

This project is a basic ETL process for analyzing Ft. Lauderdale vandalism data using Python scripts. The ETL process extracts data from the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department Open Data Portal, transforms it, and loads it into a SQL database. The Python script 'vandalism_analysis.py', pulls data from this SQL database and generates a bar chart that visualizes the frequency of vandalism by zip code. Still in progress.
